    The MX Platform API is a powerful, fully-featured API designed to make aggregating and enhancing financial data easy and reliable. It can seamlessly connect your app or website to tens of thousands of financial institutions.

    ## What's Changed?

    Several endpoints, headers, and fields changed in `v20250224`. For more on breaking changes, refer to our [versioning](https://docs.mx.com/api-reference/platform-api/overview/versioning#v20250224) and [migration](https://docs.mx.com/api-reference/platform-api/overview/migration) guides.

    ## Version Header
    Versions are set in the `Accept-Version` header of API requests. Version numbers correspond with the date associated with that version.  The example below uses the version `v20250224`.

    ```
    -H 'Accept: application/json'
    -H 'Accept-Version: v20250224'
    ```

    description: |
      The Accounts endpoints represent a user's checking, savings, mortgage, 401(k), or other types of accounts held by a financial institution.

      An account belongs to a `member`, which represents the user's overall relationship with a particular financial institution. A checking account may be just one part of a larger relationship that could also include a car loan and a savings account.

      Accounts—and the transactions associated with them—are updated every 24 hours, unless the associated `user` is disabled.

      You can also create manual accounts. Since a manual account has no credentials tied to the member, the account will never aggregate or include data from a data feed. All manual accounts are automatically created under the Manual Institution member.
  - name: ach return
    description: |
      The features documented here are in a beta state, and this documentation is considered draft material subject to frequent change.

      Using our Platform API, you can securely submit ACH Returns to reduce your ACH return rates and automate your ACH return process.

      You can query the status and outcomes of your submitted ACH returns to track progress and access resolution details.
  - name: budgets
    description: |
      Use these endpoints to create and manage budgets for your end users.

      You can create a budget for a specific category or autogenerate a budget for several categories based on existing transactions.

      Each budget has a `category_guid`, relating to one of the [categories](docs.mx.com/api-reference/platform-api/reference/default-categories/).
  - name: categories
    description: |
      A `transaction` can have its `category` set to one of MX’s default categories or a custom category for a specific `user`. 

      See [Default Categories and Subcategories](docs.mx.com/api-reference/platform-api/reference/default-categories/) for a complete list.
  - name: deprecated
  - name: goals
    description: |
      Use these endpoints to create and manage goals for a `user`. You can also reposition goals to adjust their priority levels.

      Every goal has a track type and a meta type.

      The [track type](docs.mx.com/api-reference/platform-api/reference/goal-fields/#goal-track-type) is the overall classification of the goal (debt, savings, retirement, or emergency fund) while the [meta type](/api-reference/platform-api/reference/goal-fields/#goal-meta-type) is the specific classification (like college, house, vacation, and so on).
  - name: insights
    description: |
      Use these endpoints to build customizable user experiences in UIs powered by our Financial Insights data.

      With Financial Insights, your users will receive personalized insights based on their transaction history.

      Want to learn more about the product? See [Financial Insights](docs.mx.com/products/experience/insights).

      Looking for a guide to use these endpoints? See [Build Your Own Insights UI](docs.mx.com/products/experience/insights/developer-guides/insights-api-guide).
  - name: institutions
    description: |
      Institutions represent a financial institution.

      A single real-world financial institution may have several `institution` objects on the MX platform.

      For example, the mortgage division of a financial institution might use a separate system than its everyday banking division, which is different from its credit card division.

      For more info, see [Institutions Overview](docs.mx.com/api-reference/reference/institutions).
  - name: investment holdings
    description: |
      Investment Data Enhancement lets you connect to an end user's financial institution and retrieve cleansed and enhanced investment data. By combining investment data with retail banking information, you get comprehensive insights into customer financial behaviors, risk tolerance, and investment strategies.

      You can [read a user's holding](docs.mx.com/api-reference/platform-api/reference/read-holding), [list all their holdings](docs.mx.com/api-reference/platform-api/reference/list-holdings), or list their holdings by [account](docs.mx.com/api-reference/platform-api/reference/list-holdings-by-account) or [member](docs.mx.com/api-reference/platform-api/reference/list-holdings-by-member).

      You can also [deactivate a user](docs.mx.com/api-reference/platform-api/reference/deactivate-user) from the Investment Data Enhancement. This is non-billable.
  - name: managed data
  - name: members
    description: |
      Members represent the connection between an end user and a financial institution. This institution may represent your institution or another one from which MX is aggregating data.

      For more info, see [Members Overview](docs.mx.com/api-reference/reference/members).
  - name: merchants
    description: |
      Merchants are representations of a transaction’s origin. For example, if you buy a coffee at Starbucks, the transaction merchant will be `Starbucks`.

      Use the `merchant_guid` and a `merchant_location_guidon` any `transaction` object to access Merchant endpoints for details like the merchant’s name, logo URL, website, street address, and more.
  - name: microdeposits
    description: |
      Microdeposits is an additional verification method that allows you to verify account details and navigate the process of using microdeposits and the automated clearing house (ACH) system. 

      Make two, small ACH deposits into a consumer's account using the provided account and routing number. You can then require that the end user confirm the exact amount of each deposit to verify that they own the account and meet NACHA’s account verification.

      For more info, including process flows, setting block lists, and more, see [Microdeposits](docs.mx.com/products/connectivity/microdeposits).
  - name: monthly cash flow profile
  - name: notifications
    description: |
      You can only use notifications endpoints if you’re using the MX mobile application.

      All notifications created through the API will be of notification type `API_NOTIFICATION`, channel `PUSH`, and will not be associated to an entity. No other channels are supported.

      The read and list endpoints can return any notification associated with the `user`, including notifications created by MX for other channels besides `PUSH`.
  - name: processor token
  - name: rewards
  - name: spending plan
    description: |
      Use the Spending Plan endpoints to create your own version of our [Spending Plan Widget](docs.mx.com/products/experience/pfm/legacy-widget-overviews/spending-plan), which helps end users track their spending throughout the month.

      To understand key terms and how to best use these endpoints, see [Build Your Own Spending Plan UI](docs.mx.com/products/experience/pfm/developer-guides/build-your-own-spending-plan-ui).
  - name: statements
    description: |
      With Statements, you can retrieve a user's monthly account statements in PDF format. This data can be used for solutions like personal financial management or risk analysis.
  - name: taggings
    description: |
      Tags and taggings are two resources in the MX Platform API that, when used together, give end users more control over organizing their transactions. 

      A tag is a custom label that can be applied to a transaction.

      After you create a tag, use it for tagging. This means you should actually apply the tag to a particular transaction.

      Together, they're a powerful tool for personalization, customization, and money management.

      For a guide on creating a tag and then applying it to a specific transaction with a tagging, see [Custom Tags and Taggings](docs.mx.com/products/experience/pfm/developer-guides/personalization/).

  - name: transaction rules
    description: |
      Transaction Rules allow users to automatically recategorize or rename all similar transactions according to their preferences. This only applies to future transactions.

      When recategorizing or renaming a transaction, the user will be asked whether they want the new data to apply to the selected transaction or to all future transactions. If they choose to apply it to all future transactions, it will create a transaction rule which will automatically apply the changes going forward.
  - name: transactions
    description: |
      Transactions represent any instance in which money moves into or out of an account. This could be a purchase at a business, a payroll deposit, a transfer from one account to another, an ATM withdrawal, and so on.

      Transactions are created automatically when a member is successfully aggregated.

      Each `transaction` belongs to only one `account`.

      For more info, see [Transactions Overview](docs.mx.com/api-reference/reference/transactions).
  - name: users
    description: |
      Users represent an end user using the Platform API through your web or mobile app.

      Users are created by MX clients and belong to a specific [client](docs.mx.com/products/connectivity/overview/introduction/data-architecture/#clients) on the platform.
  - name: verifiable credentials
    description: |
      MX provides Verifiable Credential endpoints that comply with web5 standards. 

      For more info, see [Verifiable Credentials Overview](docs.mx.com/api-reference/reference/verifiable-credentials).
  - name: widgets
    description: |
      Use the [Request Widget URL](docs.mx.com/api-reference/platform-api/reference/request-widget-url) endpoint to generate a URL that loads one of our widgets.

      Many request body parameters only work for some widgets.

      For more info, including widget types, see [Widgets Overview](docs.mx.com/api-reference/reference/widgets).

The API will respond with the newly-created user object if successful, containing a `guid` that you'll set as the `user_guid` in other requests when required. Disabling a user means that accounts and transactions associated with it will not be updated in the background by MX. It will also restrict access to that user’s data until they are no longer disabled.

      description: This endpoint allows you to create a new member. Members are created with the required parameters credentials and institution_code, and the optional parameters id and metadata. When creating a member, you'll need to include the correct type of credential required by the financial institution and provided by the user. You can find out which credential type is required with the `/institutions/{institution_code}/credentials` endpoint. If successful, the MX Platform API will respond with the newly-created member object. Once you successfully create a member, MX will immediately validate the provided credentials and attempt to aggregate data for accounts and transactions.

        Get an embeddable URL for integrating a widget into your website or app. The URL expires after ten minutes or upon first use, whichever occurs first. You'll need to obtain a new URL each time the page loads or reloads.

        Include the `widget_type` in the request body to specify which widget you want to embed—the Connect Widget, a Personal Financial Management widget, or an Insights widget. Some request parameters are specific to certain widget types.

        To embed the Connect Widget, set `widget_type` to `connect_widget`.

        For a full list of available widget types, see [Widget Types](https://docs.mx.com/api-reference/platform-api/reference/widgets#widget-types).

      description: This endpoint will automatically create budgets for several categories based on existing transactions; these budgets are returned as an array. Specifically, budgets will only be generated if the `user` has at least one `transaction` in a given category during each of the two previous calendar months. For example, if the request is made on March 6, and there is at least one "Bills & Utilities" `transaction` in both January and February, a budget will be generated for "Bills & Utilities." If there are two "Bills & Utilities" transactions in February but none in January, no budget will be generated for that category. If budgets already exist for particular categories, new budgets will be generated and returned based on the available transactions. If one or more budgets remain unchanged, they will nevertheless be returned in the response. If no transaction data for the `user` meet the above criteria, a `422 Unprocessable Entity` error will be returned with status code 4221 along with the message, `There aren't enough transactions to automatically create any budgets`.

      description: |
        This endpoint creates two or more child transactions that are branched from a previous transaction. This endpoint allows you to link multiple categories, descriptions, and amounts to a parent transaction.  When a split transaction is created, the parent transaction's `has_been_split` field will automatically be updated to true and the child transactions' `parent_guid` will have the transaction guid of the parent. The total amount of the child transactions must equal the amount of the parent transaction. Once a transaction has been split it can't be split again.    In order to re-split a transaction, it must first be un-split. This can be done by calling the Delete Split Transactions endpoint. Calling this endpoint will delete the existing child transactions and update the parent transaction's `has_been_split` field to false. You can then re-split the parent transaction by calling Create Split Transaction again.

      summary: Create or pre-initiate a microdeposit
      description: |
        Use this endpoint to create or pre-initiate a microdeposit. The response will include the new microdeposit record with a status of `INITIATED` or `PREINITIATED` respectively.

        To pre-initiate a microdeposit, you only need to set `email` (string), `first_name` (string), and `last_name` (string) in the request body. 

        Pre-initiating a microdeposit allows you to pass the end user's first name, last name, and email if this data has already been collected. If the end user selects an institution which requires the microdeposit flow, the pre-initiated `micro_deposit` will be used and the Connect Widget step that normally requests this info from the end user will be skipped. However, if the end user selects an institution which supports IAV, the pre-initiated `micro_deposit` will be deleted and IAV will be used instead. When requesting a Connect Widget URL after pre-initiating, make sure to set the `current_microdeposit_guid` to the resulting microdeposit's `guid` and set the `mode` to `verification`. If you use this enhanced flow, a `micro_deposit` should be pre-initiated for all connect sessions in verification mode. After pre-initiating a microdeposit, pass the GUID to the config as `current_microdeposit_guid` and set the `mode` to `verification` when requesting a Connect URL.  Pre-initiating a microdeposit is optional. If you choose to implement this flow, it should be used for all Connect Widget sessions in verification mode.

        The query options may be combined to specific enhancements. For example, to request Repeating Transactions and Geolocation data, use: 

        `?includes=repeating_transactions,geolocations`.

        - Repeating Transactions: Identifies transactions with predictable recurrence patterns (e.g., Bill, Income, Subscription).
        - Merchants: Enriches transactions with merchant name.
        - Classifications: Provides more insight into the type of money movement that is occurring on the transaction, whether it be retail or investments.
        - Geolocation: Provides geographic metadata.

            The status of the transaction.

            All transaction data on our systems represent what we get through our data feed which depends what institutions make available for aggregation. Many institutions do not provide data for pending transactions; transactions from those accounts always have a status of `POSTED`.

            When we do receive data for pending transactions, a single transaction may be updated from `PENDING` to `POSTED` and keep the same `guid`. This is done through various matching methods performed automatically by MX.

            If a single transaction can't be updated, the `PENDING` transaction will often be deleted and replaced with a new `POSTED` transaction (with a new `guid`) when it is sent to us; this is the most common scenario when pending data is available.

            In unusual circumstances, there may be separate `PENDING` and `POSTED` transactions on MX systems for up to 14 days. All `PENDING` transactions are deleted after 14 days as a failsafe.

            The status of the transaction.

            All transaction data on our systems represent what we get through our data feed which depends what institutions make available for aggregation. Many institutions do not provide data for pending transactions; transactions from those accounts always have a status of `POSTED`.

            When we do receive data for pending transactions, a single transaction may be updated from `PENDING` to `POSTED` and keep the same `guid`. This is done through various matching methods performed automatically by MX.

            If a single transaction can't be updated, the `PENDING` transaction will often be deleted and replaced with a new `POSTED` transaction (with a new `guid`) when it is sent to us; this is the most common scenario when pending data is available.

            In unusual circumstances, there may be separate `PENDING` and `POSTED` transactions on MX systems for up to 14 days. All `PENDING` transactions are deleted after 14 days as a failsafe.

            The date and time the most recent aggregation-type job was started, given in ISO 8601 format with a time component.

            A job will automatically be started when a member is created or its credentials are updated, unless the `skip_aggregation` parameter is used.

            Jobs can also be started via manual aggregations, background aggregations, API endpoints, or when opening an MX widget.

            A job can be a normal aggregation, or a premium job such as identification, verification, fetching statements, or fetching an extended transaction history.

            If a member is deleted and then re-created with the `skip_aggregation` parameter set to `true` or if it is re-created within the throttle window (typically three hours), the previous value will be returned.

          description: |
            Only use this option if the `widget_type` is set to `connect_widget`. `mode` is the most important option for the Connect Widget. This determines what kind of process Connect will run, which affects how you should set many other options. Defaults to `aggregation`. `aggregation` mode retrieves account and transaction data; in other words, this runs a standard aggregation. `verification` mode retrieves account numbers and routing/transit numbers; in other words, it runs an Instant Account Verification (IAV). By default, verification mode does not retrieve transaction data; this default can be modified with secondary options. By default, background aggregation is disabled for all members created in verification mode; this default can be modified with secondary options.

            Only use this option if the `widget_type` is set to `connect_widget`. This determines how MX will respond to the result of an OAuth flow. When set to `APP`, MX will redirect to the URI specified in the `ui_message_webview_url_scheme`. When set to `BROWSER`, MX will send a postMessage but not redirect. If `is_mobile_webview` is `true`, this defaults to `APP`. If false, it defaults to `BROWSER`.

        ui_message_webview_url_scheme:
          type: string
          description: |
            Only use this option if the `widget_type` is set to `connect_widget`. This is a client-defined scheme used in OAuth redirects in WebViews; also used in URL updates when these replace postMessages in WebViews. Defaults to `mx`.
        update_credentials:
          example: false
          type: boolean
          description: |
            Only use this option if the `widget_type` is set to `connect_widget`. Load the widget into a view that allows them to update the current member. Optionally used with `current_member_guid`. This option should be used sparingly. The best practice is to use `current_member_guid` and let the widget resolve the issue.
